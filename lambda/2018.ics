DESCRIPTION:....  \n\n.... Jack Wall & Studio Ensemble\n\n*Jack Wall* is an
  ASCAP award-winning and BAFTA nominated composer best known  for his rich
 , cinematic scores found within popular video game franchises  such as Ca
 ll of Duty: Black Ops II & III, Mass Effect I & II, the Myst  series, J
 ade Empire and several other franchises winning multiple awards for  his w
 ork. Wall is currently composing for the supernatural drama television  se
 ries Shadowhunters: The Mortal Instruments airing on Disney’s Freeform  TV
 . He has also written additional music score for numerous other TV series 
  including the fantasy drama series Reign on the CW and Emerald City on NB
 C as  well as scoring the hi-octane action film Hard Target 2 available on
  Netflix.  Shadowhunters Season 3 premieres in March 2018 on Freeform, On
  Demand and  Hulu.\n\nWall is celebrated among a Hollywood elite of compos
 ers invited to score the  world’s biggest interactive entertainment proper
 ty, Call of Duty. For Black  Ops II he crafted an adrenaline-fueled, dee
 ply emotional and adventurous  musical palette that took the blockbuster s
 eries in new sonic directions.  Black Ops II received the Best Video Game 
 Score Award at the ASCAP Film and  Television Music Awards. Reuniting with
  Treyarch Studios and Activision for  Black Ops III, his follow-up score 
 displays the hallmarks of an epic,  sophisticated narrative, combining f
 uturistic hybrid sounds, homages to  classic WWII orchestral music and ev
 en big band and swing numbers created  specifically for the Zombie campaig
 n. Featuring highlight solo performances  from contemporary jazz vocalist 
 Antonia Bennett, daughter of legendary singer  Tony Bennett, Black Ops I
 II was nominated GameTrailers’ Soundtrack of the  Year.\n\nCollaborating w
 ith the world’s leading game studios, Wall is widely  recognized for comp
 osing some of the most iconic scores for the medium. Wall  created the dis
 tinctive musical signature for BioWare’s sci-fi epic Mass  Effect, combin
 ing ’80s electronica, synthetic instrumentation and  futuristic atmospher
 es. The soundtrack won numerous accolades, while  achieving cult status w
 ith fans. Wall received British Academy (BAFTA) and  Spike TV nominations 
 for his work on Mass Effect 2.\n\nComposing for and conducting a full symp
 hony orchestra and master chorale,  Wall first garnered attention with hi
 s dramatic score for Ubisoft’s Myst  III: Exile, receiving universal crit
 ical acclaim including several Soundtrack  of the Year honors. For the cli
 mactic sequel, Myst IV: Revelation, Wall was  awarded Music of the Year 
 at the Game Developers Conference.\n\nWith Jade Empire, Wall crafted a Ch
 inese and Asian instrumental palette  incorporating an “East meets West” a
 pproach. Working with authentic  Pan-Asian instruments Wall crafted an exo
 tic, percussion-driven score to  enhance the mythological Chinese setting
 . The score was voted Best Original  Soundtrack Album by the Game Audio Ne
 twork Guild.\n\nIn addition to his composing achievements, Wall served as
  Music Director and  co-producer for composer/librettist Cindy Shapiro’s P
 SYCHE: A Modern Rock  Opera, an innovative modern retelling of the ancien
 t Greek. He also  co-created Video Games Live and served as its Music Dire
 ctor/Conductor from  2005 through 2010 performing with more than fifty of 
 the world’s finest  orchestras including the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Ho
 llywood Bowl Orchestra  and London Philharmonia Orchestra.\n\nWall was co-
 founder of The Game Audio Network Guild and is a frequent  speaker/instruc
 tor at various educational institutions such as Columbia  College, USC, 
 UCLA, Expressions Center for New Media, The Los Angeles  Recording Schoo
 l and Berklee College in Boston.\n\nContinuing to raise the bar for emotio
 nal, performance-driven scores at the  highest level, Wall’s repertoire 
 encompasses a diverse range of musical  styles and influences: from ethere
 al ambience, choral crescendos and heavy  tribal orchestra to traditional
  Asian, Middle-Eastern, Eastern European  instrumentation, futuristic e
 lectronic soundscapes and big band jazz recorded  with the world’s top mus
 icians. For more information visit www.jackwall.net  [1].\n\n.... To purch
